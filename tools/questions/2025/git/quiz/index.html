  const questions = [{"title": "What is the primary purpose of Git?","options": ["File compression","Web server hosting","Database management","Distributed version control system"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently and maintains a complete history of changes."},{"title": "What is a Git remote?","options": ["A commit message","A merge conflict","A local branch","A reference to a repository hosted elsewhere"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "A Git remote is a reference to a repository hosted elsewhere (like GitHub, GitLab). It allows you to synchronize your local repository with repositories on other servers."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Hidden folder","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes","Backup location","Archive file"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does 'git cherry-pick' do?","options": ["Choose remote","Pick repository","Select files","Apply specific commit to current branch"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git cherry-pick applies the changes from a specific commit to your current branch without merging the entire branch."},{"title": "What is a Git hook?","options": ["Fishing tool","Branch connection","Remote link","Script triggered by Git events"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, like committing or pushing."},{"title": "What is Git LFS?","options": ["Live File Sync","Large File Storage extension","Local File Storage","Linux File System"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension that handles large files by storing them outside the main repository."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Find bug-introducing commit","Cut files","Divide branches","Split repository"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Backup location","Archive file","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes","Hidden folder"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does

the main repository."},{"title": "Which command shows the current status of the working directory and staging area?","options": ["git diff","git status","git log","git info"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "git status shows the current state of the working directory and staging area, displaying which files are modified, staged for commit, or untracked."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Split repository","Divide branches","Cut files","Find bug-introducing commit"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Archive file","Hidden folder","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes","Backup location"],"answer":

repository."},{"title": "Which Git command is used to create a new branch?","options": ["git create <branch-name>","git make <branch-name>","git new <branch-name>","git branch <branch-name>"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "The 'git branch <branch-name>' command creates a new branch. You can also use 'git checkout -b <branch-name>' to create and switch to the new branch in one command."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Cut files","Find bug-introducing commit","Divide branches","Split repository"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Archive file","Backup location","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes","Hidden folder"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does 'git cherry-pick' do?","options": ["Select files","Choose remote","Apply specific commit to current branch","Pick repository"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git cherry-pick applies the changes from a specific commit to your current branch without merging the entire branch."},{"title": "What is a Git hook?","options": ["Branch connection","Script triggered by Git events","Remote link","Fishing tool"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, like committing or pushing."},{"title": "What is Git LFS?","options": ["Local File Storage","Live File Sync","Linux File System","Large File Storage extension"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension that handles large files by storing them outside the main repository."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Find bug-introducing commit","Cut files","Split repository","Divide branches"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Archive file","Backup location","Hidden folder","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does 'git cherry-pick' do?","options": ["Choose remote","Select files","Apply specific commit to current branch","Pick repository"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git cherry-pick applies the changes from a specific commit to your current branch without merging the entire branch."},{"title": "What is a Git hook?","options": ["Remote link","Script triggered by Git events","Branch connection","Fishing tool"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, like committing or pushing."},{"title": "What is Git LFS?","options": ["Local File Storage","Live File Sync","Linux File System","Large File Storage extension"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension that handles large files by storing them outside the main repository."},{"title": "What does 'git merge' do?","options": ["Combines changes from different branches","Deletes a branch","Reverts commits","Creates a new repository"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Git merge combines changes from different branches. It integrates commits from one branch into another, typically merging a feature branch into the main branch."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Split repository","Cut files","Divide branches","Find bug-introducing commit"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "Which command shows the commit history?","options": ["git diff","git status","git show","git log"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "The 'git log' command displays the commit history, showing commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages. Various options can customize the output format."},{"title": "What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?","options": ["git pull fetches and merges, git fetch only downloads","No difference, they are identical","git fetch is faster than git pull","git pull works offline, git fetch requires internet"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "git fetch downloads changes from the remote repository without merging them, while git pull performs a fetch followed by a merge, updating your current branch with remote changes."},{"title": "Which file is used to specify files that Git should ignore?","options": [".gitignore",".ignore",".exclude",".gitexclude"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It contains patterns matching files and directories that should not be tracked by version control."},{"title": "What does 'git rebase' do?","options": ["Creates a new repository","Merges two repositories","Deletes all commits","Reapplies commits on top of another base tip"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git rebase reapplies commits on top of another base tip, creating a linear project history. It's an alternative to merging that results in a cleaner commit history."},{"title": "Which command undoes the last commit but keeps the changes in the working directory?","options": ["git revert HEAD","git reset --soft HEAD~1","git reset --hard HEAD~1","git delete HEAD~1"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "git reset --soft HEAD~1 moves the HEAD pointer back one commit but keeps the changes in the staging area, allowing you to modify and recommit them."}];
