It allows you to synchronize your local repository with repositories on other servers."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Hidden folder","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes","Backup location","Archive file"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does 'git cherry-pick' do?","options": ["Choose remote","Pick repository","Select files","Apply specific commit to current branch"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git cherry-pick applies the changes from a specific commit to your current branch without merging the entire branch."},{"title": "What is a Git hook?","options": ["Fishing tool","Branch connection","Remote link","Script triggered by Git events"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, like committing or pushing."},{"title": "What is Git LFS?","options": ["Live File Sync","Large File Storage extension","Local File Storage","Linux File System"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension that handles large files by storing them outside the main repository."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Find bug-introducing commit","Cut files","Divide branches","Split repository"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Git bisect

<branch-name>"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "The 'git branch <branch-name>' command creates a new branch. You can also use 'git checkout -b <branch-name>' to create and switch to the new branch in one command."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Cut files","Find bug-introducing commit","Divide branches","Split repository"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Archive file","Backup location","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes","Hidden folder"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does 'git cherry-pick' do?","options": ["Select files","Choose remote","Apply specific commit to current branch","Pick repository"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git cherry-pick applies the changes from a specific commit to your current branch without merging the entire branch."},{"title": "What is a Git hook?","options": ["Branch connection","Script triggered by Git events","Remote link","Fishing tool"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, like committing or pushing."},{"title": "What is Git LFS?","options": ["Local File Storage","Live File Sync","Linux File System","Large File Storage extension"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension that handles large files by storing them outside the main repository."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Find bug-introducing commit","Cut files","Split repository","Divide branches"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "What is a Git stash?","options": ["Archive file","Backup location","Hidden folder","Temporary storage for uncommitted changes"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else and come back later."},{"title": "What does 'git cherry-pick' do?","options": ["Choose remote","Select files","Apply specific commit to current branch","Pick repository"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Git cherry-pick applies the changes from a specific commit to your current branch without merging the entire branch."},{"title": "What is a Git hook?","options": ["Remote link","Script triggered by Git events","Branch connection","Fishing tool"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur, like committing or pushing."},{"title": "What is Git LFS?","options": ["Local File Storage","Live File Sync","Linux File System","Large File Storage extension"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension that handles large files by storing them outside the main repository."},{"title": "What does 'git merge' do?","options": ["Combines changes from different branches","Deletes a branch","Reverts commits","Creates a new repository"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Git merge combines changes from different branches. It integrates commits from one branch into another, typically merging a feature branch into the main branch."},{"title": "What does 'git bisect' help with?","options": ["Split repository","Cut files","Divide branches","Find bug-introducing commit"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git bisect uses binary search to help find the commit that introduced a bug by testing different commits."},{"title": "Which command shows the commit history?","options": ["git diff","git status","git show","git log"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "The 'git log' command displays the commit history, showing commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages.

It contains patterns matching files and directories that should not be tracked by version control."},{"title": "What does 'git rebase' do?","options": ["Creates a new repository","Merges two repositories","Deletes all commits","Reapplies commits on top of another base tip"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Git rebase reapplies commits on top of another base tip, creating a linear project history. It's an alternative to merging that results in a cleaner commit history."},{"title": "Which command undoes the last commit but keeps the changes in the working directory?","options": ["git revert HEAD","git reset --soft HEAD~1","git reset --hard HEAD~1","git delete HEAD~1"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "git reset --soft HEAD~1 moves the HEAD pointer back one commit but keeps the changes in the staging area, allowing you to modify and recommit them."}];
