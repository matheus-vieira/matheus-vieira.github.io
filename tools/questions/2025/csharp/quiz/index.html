  const questions = [{"title": "What is the difference between value types and reference types in C#?","options": ["There is no difference between them","Reference types are always immutable","Value types are slower than reference types","Value types store data directly, reference types store memory addresses"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Value types (int, char, bool, struct) store data directly in memory stack, while reference types (class, interface, delegate) store references to memory addresses on the heap where the actual data is stored."},{"title": "What is the primary purpose of delegates in C#?","options": ["Data storage","String manipulation","Memory allocation","Type-safe function pointers"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Delegates are type-safe function pointers that can hold references to both static and instance methods. They enable callbacks, event handling, and functional programming patterns."},{"title": "What is nullable reference types in C#?","options": ["Reference types only","Value types only","Types that can be null by default","Feature to help avoid null reference exceptions"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Nullable reference types is a feature that helps developers avoid null reference exceptions by making the compiler aware of null possibilities."},{"title": "What is record type in C#?","options": ["Immutable reference type with value semantics","Performance metric","Audio recording","Database record"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Record types provide a concise syntax for creating reference types with immutable properties and value-based equality."},{"title": "What is pattern matching in C#?","options": ["Regular expressions","String pattern search","File pattern matching","Technique for checking value shapes and extracting data"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Pattern matching allows you to test if a value has a certain shape and extract information from the value when it does."},{"title": "What is the 'var' keyword in C#?","options": ["Virtual method","Variable declaration","Implicit type declaration","Variant type"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "The 'var' keyword enables implicit typing, where the compiler determines the type based on the assigned value."},{"title": "What are tuples in C#?","options": ["Array type","Exception type","Lightweight data structure for multiple values","Loop construct"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Tuples provide a lightweight way to have a data structure that holds multiple values without creating a separate class."},{"title": "What is nullable reference types in C#?","options": ["Feature to help avoid null reference exceptions","Reference types only","Value types only","Types that can be null by default"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Nullable reference types is a feature that helps developers avoid null reference exceptions by making the compiler aware of null possibilities."},{"title": "What is record type in C#?","options": ["Performance metric","Database record","Immutable reference type with value semantics","Audio recording"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Record types provide a concise syntax for creating reference types with immutable properties and value-based equality."},{"title": "What is pattern matching in C#?","options": ["Technique for checking value shapes and extracting data","String pattern search","File pattern matching","Regular expressions"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Pattern matching allows you to test if a value has a certain shape and extract information from the value when it does."},{"title": "What is the 'var' keyword in C#?","options": ["Virtual method","Variant type","Implicit type declaration","Variable declaration"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "The 'var' keyword enables implicit typing, where the compiler determines the type based on the assigned value."},{"title": "Which C# feature allows you to add methods to existing types without modifying them?","options": ["Polymorphism","Overloading","Extension methods","Inheritance"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code or creating derived types. They are defined as static methods in static classes."},{"title": "What are tuples in C#?","options": ["Exception type","Loop construct","Array type","Lightweight data structure for multiple values"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Tuples provide a lightweight way to have a data structure that holds multiple values without creating a separate class."},{"title": "What is nullable reference types in C#?","options": ["Reference types only","Feature to help avoid null reference exceptions","Value types only","Types that can be null by default"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Nullable reference types is a feature that helps developers avoid null reference exceptions by making the compiler aware of null possibilities."},{"title": "What is record type in C#?","options": ["Database record","Immutable reference type with value semantics","Performance metric","Audio recording"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Record types provide a concise syntax for creating reference types with immutable properties and value-based equality."},{"title": "What is pattern matching in C#?","options": ["Technique for checking value shapes and extracting data","Regular expressions","String pattern search","File pattern matching"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Pattern matching allows you to test if a value has a certain shape and extract information from the value when it does."},{"title": "What is the 'var' keyword in C#?","options": ["Implicit type declaration","Variable declaration","Virtual method","Variant type"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "The 'var' keyword enables implicit typing, where the compiler determines the type based on the assigned value."},{"title": "What are tuples in C#?","options": ["Lightweight data structure for multiple values","Exception type","Loop construct","Array type"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Tuples provide a lightweight way to have a data structure that holds multiple values without creating a separate class."},{"title": "What is nullable reference types in C#?","options": ["Reference types only","Feature to help avoid null reference exceptions","Value types only","Types that can be null by default"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "Nullable reference types is a feature that helps developers avoid null reference exceptions by making the compiler aware of null possibilities."},{"title": "What is record type in C#?","options": ["Immutable reference type with value semantics","Performance metric","Audio recording","Database record"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Record types provide a concise syntax for creating reference types with immutable properties and value-based equality."},{"title": "What is pattern matching in C#?","options": ["String pattern search","Regular expressions","Technique for checking value shapes and extracting data","File pattern matching"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Pattern matching allows you to test if a value has a certain shape and extract information from the value when it does."},{"title": "What is the 'var' keyword in C#?","options": ["Virtual method","Variant type","Implicit type declaration","Variable declaration"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "The 'var' keyword enables implicit typing, where the compiler determines the type based on the assigned value."},{"title": "Which access modifier makes a member accessible only within the same assembly?","options": ["public","protected","internal","private"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "The 'internal' access modifier makes members accessible only within the same assembly. It provides more access than private but less than public, being assembly-scoped."},{"title": "What are tuples in C#?","options": ["Lightweight data structure for multiple values","Array type","Exception type","Loop construct"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Tuples provide a lightweight way to have a data structure that holds multiple values without creating a separate class."},{"title": "What is nullable reference types in C#?","options": ["Value types only","Reference types only","Feature to help avoid null reference exceptions","Types that can be null by default"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Nullable reference types is a feature that helps developers avoid null reference exceptions by making the compiler aware of null possibilities."},{"title": "What is record type in C#?","options": ["Audio recording","Performance metric","Database record","Immutable reference type with value semantics"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Record types provide a concise syntax for creating reference types with immutable properties and value-based equality."},{"title": "What is pattern matching in C#?","options": ["Technique for checking value shapes and extracting data","Regular expressions","String pattern search","File pattern matching"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Pattern matching allows you to test if a value has a certain shape and extract information from the value when it does."},{"title": "What is the 'var' keyword in C#?","options": ["Implicit type declaration","Virtual method","Variant type","Variable declaration"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "The 'var' keyword enables implicit typing, where the compiler determines the type based on the assigned value."},{"title": "What are tuples in C#?","options": ["Lightweight data structure for multiple values","Array type","Loop construct","Exception type"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Tuples provide a lightweight way to have a data structure that holds multiple values without creating a separate class."},{"title": "What is nullable reference types in C#?","options": ["Feature to help avoid null reference exceptions","Types that can be null by default","Reference types only","Value types only"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Nullable reference types is a feature that helps developers avoid null reference exceptions by making the compiler aware of null possibilities."},{"title": "What is record type in C#?","options": ["Immutable reference type with value semantics","Audio recording","Performance metric","Database record"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Record types provide a concise syntax for creating reference types with immutable properties and value-based equality."},{"title": "What is pattern matching in C#?","options": ["Technique for checking value shapes and extracting data","Regular expressions","String pattern search","File pattern matching"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Pattern matching allows you to test if a value has a certain shape and extract information from the value when it does."},{"title": "What is the 'var' keyword in C#?","options": ["Variant type","Implicit type declaration","Virtual method","Variable declaration"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "The 'var' keyword enables implicit typing, where the compiler determines the type based on the assigned value."},{"title": "What is the purpose of the 'using' statement in C#?","options": ["Automatic resource disposal and namespace imports","Defining classes","Only for importing namespaces","Creating variables"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "The 'using' statement serves two purposes: importing namespaces and ensuring automatic disposal of resources that implement IDisposable, providing proper resource management."},{"title": "What are tuples in C#?","options": ["Array type","Exception type","Loop construct","Lightweight data structure for multiple values"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "Tuples provide a lightweight way to have a data structure that holds multiple values without creating a separate class."},{"title": "Which C# feature allows multiple inheritance of contracts?","options": ["Interfaces","Structs","Enums","Classes"],"answer": 1,"explanation": "Interfaces allow multiple inheritance in C#. A class can implement multiple interfaces, inheriting their contracts (method signatures) but not implementation, providing flexibility in design."},{"title": "What is the difference between 'const' and 'readonly' in C#?","options": ["No difference, they are identical","readonly can only be used with strings","const is compile-time constant, readonly is runtime constant","const is runtime constant, readonly is compile-time"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "const values are compile-time constants and must be assigned at declaration, while readonly values are runtime constants that can be assigned in constructors or at declaration."},{"title": "Which LINQ method would you use to transform each element in a collection?","options": ["OrderBy","Select","GroupBy","Where"],"answer": 2,"explanation": "The Select method is used for projection/transformation, allowing you to transform each element in a collection into a new form or extract specific properties from objects."},{"title": "What is the purpose of async/await in C#?","options": ["Synchronous programming only","Exception handling","Memory management","Asynchronous programming without blocking threads"],"answer": 4,"explanation": "async/await enables asynchronous programming, allowing methods to run without blocking the calling thread. This improves application responsiveness and scalability."},{"title": "Which C# feature introduced pattern matching capabilities?","options": ["for loops","if-else statements","switch expressions","while loops"],"answer": 3,"explanation": "Switch expressions, introduced in C# 8.0, provide powerful pattern matching capabilities, allowing more concise and expressive conditional logic compared to traditional switch statements."}];
