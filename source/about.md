Thanks for reaching out! Let me share a bit about my journeyâ€”both personal and professional.

## Matheus Costa Vieira: A journey of a Dad, a Husband, and a Software Engineer

I'm {{ current_year | minus: 1984 }} years old, born in Porto Alegre where my love for soccer and GrÃªmio began. Life took me to Santa Maria during my youth, and in 2008, I moved to Curitiba where I lived for 15 years building my career and family.

In April 2023, we achieved a dream that had been years in the makingâ€”we moved to our own home in Fazenda Rio Grande, in Curitiba's metropolitan area. This wasn't just a change of address; it was the realization of a family dream. We finally have **our house, exactly the way my family and I had always envisioned it**.

**Family is everything to me.** I'm married to Daniela Priscila Lins, and we have a beautiful son, Pedro Henrique, who's now 15. We also had a precious daughter, Ana Carolina, who passed away in 2013 but whose memory and values continue to guide everything I do. She remains my beloved angel, and honoring her legacy is part of who I am today.

## How Technology Found Me

My path into technology wasn't plannedâ€”it started with curiosity. In 2006, after a basic computer course during administrative practices training, a professor suggested I try a technical course. "You seem to enjoy this," he said. He was right.

Those first classes with Delphi and PHP opened my eyes to the power of programming. I'll never forget my PHP professor who showed me how code could solve real problems, or the excitement of helping develop a "yellow pages" system for our city. That moment sparked something that's driven me for **{{ current_year | minus: 2008 }}+ years** now.

## Balancing Life and Code

Working from home has been a blessingâ€”it allows me to be present for the moments that matter. I can have lunch with my family, help Pedro with homework, and be there for important milestones. This balance isn't just nice to have; it's essential for who I want to be as a father and professional.

My values are simple but deep: **family first, continuous learning, and hard work**. Every professional decision I make considers how it impacts my family's future. They're not just my motivation; they're actively involved in my choices because they're what I value most in life.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting systems or mentoring teams, you'll find me:

- **Grilling with family and friends** (a true gaÃºcho tradition I cherish)
- **Cheering for GrÃªmio** (once a gremista, always a gremista! âšªðŸ”µâš«)
- **Cooking and experimenting** with traditional southern Brazilian recipes
- **Traveling frequently** to visit family in FlorianÃ³polis, Santos, and Matinhos
- **Exploring new places**â€”I've enjoyed two Brazilian coast cruises and love visiting historical sites

## Professional Philosophy

I bring the same values to work that guide my personal life: **transparency, respect, and genuine care for people**. Whether mentoring junior developers, architecting global systems, or working with clients, I believe in open communication and shared growth.

Technology fascinates me because it solves real problemsâ€”just like that first "yellow pages" project. I stay current through conferences, blogs, and weekly posts on my own blog, always looking for ways to share knowledge and learn from others.

## Looking Forward

My dreams are beautifully intertwined: I want to continue growing End2End Systems, impacting lives through technology, while watching Pedro become the amazing adult I know he'll be. I want to travel more, explore new places, and create lasting memories with Daniela.

**Most importantly, I want to leave a legacy of love, dedication, and family values**â€”showing Pedro that success means nothing without the people who matter most by your side.

## A Humbling Reminder

And yes, I'm human! I once updated every client's city to "Curitiba" in a production database... without a WHERE clause. ðŸ˜… Thank goodness for backups! It's a reminder that we all make mistakes, but it's how we handle them and learn that defines us.
