## Introduction Microservices no Azure requerem sophisticated data management strategies for handle distributed transactions, eventual consistency e data synchronization across service boundaries. ## Key Concept **Distributed Data Management**: implementstion de patterns How Saga, CQRS e Event Sourcing for manage data consistency e transactions across microservices boundaries without sacrificing autonomy. ## TÃ³picos Relevbefore - Saga pattern for distributed transactions - CQRS for read/write sefortion - Event sourcing for audit trail - Eventually consistent data models - Service data ownership ## Practical Example E-withmerce platform with Order service, Payment service e Inventory service using Saga pattern for coordenar transactions, Event Hub for event propagation e Cosmos DB for eventual consistency. ## benefits - Service autonomy maintained - Data consistency assured - Transaction integrity preserved - Scalability per service - Resilience improved
