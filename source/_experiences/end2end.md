# Job Description

As the founder and principal engineer at End2End Systems, I provide senior software engineering consulting services to multiple clients across different industries. My work focuses on designing, developing, and modernizing scalable, cloud-native systems using cutting-edge technologies such as .NET, Azure, microservices architecture, DevOps practices, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I help organizations improve system performance, optimize architectures, implement automation, and drive software quality at scale.

- Designed and developed scalable RESTful APIs and background services using .NET Framework/.NET Core/.NET 6+.
- Architected cloud-native solutions on Azure, leveraging Functions, Durable Functions, Blob Storage, Azure SQL, and App Service.
- Reduced system response times from minutes to seconds by optimizing database queries, caching strategies, and refactoring critical backend services.
- Improved throughput and reliability by implementing asynchronous, event-driven architectures with RabbitMQ, Event Grid, and Azure Service Bus.
- Engineered distributed caching with Redis, cutting redundant database calls and enhancing user experience.
- Modernized legacy systems by migrating workloads to the cloud, refactoring monoliths into microservices, and introducing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps, enabling faster and safer deployments.
- Applied SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- Led the adoption of automated testing frameworks (xUnit, Moq, integration testing), raising code quality and reliability across teams.
- Provided technical mentorship, led architecture discussions, and conducted code reviews, helping clients evolve their engineering practices.

Support the software community.
