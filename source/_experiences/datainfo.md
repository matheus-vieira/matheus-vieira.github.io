# Job Description

At DataInfo, I worked as a Senior IT System Analyst, building integration systems for payment processing in notary offices. I focused on automating workflows and implementing asynchronous processing, which reduced evaluation times by 30%. My responsibilities included backend development with .NET MVC and Java Spring, ensuring compliance with banking standards and delivering robust, maintainable solutions for critical financial operations.
