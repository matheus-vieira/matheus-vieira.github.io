# Job Description

At GFT Brasil, I acted as a senior software engineer and technical leader, architecting event-driven ingestion systems with .NET, Azure Functions, and RabbitMQ. I led the migration of legacy batch processes to microservices, increasing throughput by 50%. My responsibilities included fullstack development (APIs and AngularJS), implementing automated testing to reach 85% coverage, and driving best practices in code quality, DevOps, and cloud architecture. I collaborated with cross-functional teams, mentored developers, and ensured the delivery of scalable, maintainable, and high-performance solutions, always focussing on business impact and engineering excellence.
