# Job Description

At Dell Technologies, I led the development of a high-throughput .NET 8 ingestion engine capable of processing over 1 million records per day, implementing robust retry and backpressure strategies. I designed and published reusable NuGet packages, reducing code duplication by 40% across teams. My work included integrating SQL Server and Elasticsearch for hybrid queries, achieving sub-200ms latency for critical operations. I implemented distributed observability using Serilog and the ELK Stack, enabling proactive monitoring and troubleshooting. Additionally, I provided technical mentorship, led architecture discussions, and conducted code reviews, fostering a culture of engineering excellence and continuous improvement.
