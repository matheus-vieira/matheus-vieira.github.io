ðŸš€ **RabbitMQ: Handling High Volumes Without Losing Control**

When your backend needs to process 100,000+ messages per minute, having a solid messaging architecture becomes critical.

In my latest blog post, I share a real-world financial transaction processing system that I've implemented in production:

âœ… **Topic Exchanges** for intelligent message routing
âœ… **Dead Letter Queues** for graceful failure handling  
âœ… **Horizontal scaling** with .NET Worker Services
âœ… **Connection pooling** for optimal performance
âœ… **Comprehensive monitoring** for full observability

**Real results:**
â€¢ 100,000+ messages/minute during peak hours
â€¢ <50ms average processing time
â€¢ 99.9% delivery success rate
â€¢ Linear scaling by adding worker instances

The combination of RabbitMQ's robustness with .NET's performance creates incredibly reliable, high-volume messaging systems.

Key lesson: Always design for failure scenarios and implement monitoring from day one.
